# Challenge 8 research

We are developing our own solution. Existing PRs are references for requirements,
review feedback and performance observations; their proof code is not imported.

For agent onboarding and autonomous GitHub-only execution, read
[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) and [the agent runbook](AGENT-RUNBOOK.md).
The owner's server is for editing and orchestration only; do not build or verify there.

## Target and scope

- Target: the standard library in this repository, not a reimplementation.
- Requirements: `doc/src/challenges/0008-smallsort.md`; discussion: upstream issue #56.
- Initial upstream commit: `dd2bbad51eb50fdf9730e14802dcaf8a9290092a`.
- Kani is pinned by `tool_config/kani-version.toml`, initially
  `152c6a8c875d9886a67e229247b4826d6105ccfd`.
- Runtime code in the standard library must not change.

## First experiment

`smoke.rs` contains two original proof harnesses for the actual `swap_if_less`:

1. For arbitrary four-element `i32` arrays, comparing positions 1 and 2 with `<`
   produces an ordered pair, preserves the exact values and leaves both neighbours unchanged.
2. For either symbolic comparator decision, those same positions preserve the
   exact values and leave both neighbours unchanged. This does not assert sortedness
   for an invalid comparator.

There are no input assumptions, behavioral stubs or copied sorting algorithms.
Reachability covers exercise less-than, equality, greater-than and both swap decisions.
These are bootstrap checks for a fixed allocation and two fixed positions. They
do not establish generic type/index coverage, comparator panic safety, uninitialized
memory safety, or the full Challenge 8 contracts. Kani's default enabled checks
apply; we do not claim that these cover every UB required by the challenge.

## Insertion experiment (prepared, not verified yet)

See [the specification and scope](insertion-contract.md).

- `insertion_contracts_4`: first verify the contract on a proof-only i32 adapter
  calling the actual std `insert_tail`; then check a three-insertion caller using
  `stub_verified`. Stages stop at the first failure.
- `insertion_direct_4`: check the actual `insertion_sort_shift_left`, with symbolic
  length 1..4 and offset 1..length, assuming only the necessary sorted prefix
  for the functional-correctness property.
- `insertion_all_4`: run all three stages in the above order.

All values are arbitrary i32, including duplicates and extremes. The experiment
checks ordering, exact multiset preservation and the untouched suffix. It uses
bounded loop unwinding (6), not loop invariants. The adapter contract is not a
contract on generic std `insert_tail`, and the summary-based caller is not std's
outer pointer loop. A passing result will establish only this small compositional
experiment; general types, arbitrary lengths and unwind safety remain future work.

## Run

In the fork's Actions tab, enable workflows if GitHub asks, choose **SmallSort
research**, click **Run workflow**, select `challenge-8/research`, and leave
`proof=insertion_all_4` and `budget_minutes=90` for the next experiment.
The existing `all`, `orders_i32_pair` and
`preserves_i32_values_for_any_decision` choices still run the original bootstrap.

The workflow definition must exist on the default branch for GitHub to expose
the manual trigger. Its dispatch branch is the source being verified.
After a source fix, start a new **Run workflow** on the updated branch. **Re-run
jobs** on an older run checks that run's original commit and will not pick up the fix.

Agents dispatch and monitor this workflow themselves using the commands in
[AGENT-RUNBOOK.md](AGENT-RUNBOOK.md). Do not execute the research runners,
Kani scripts, compilation or executable tests on the owner's server.

Use a disposable checkout: each runner appends only its cfg(kani) proof module to
`smallsort.rs` at execution time. It refuses to append twice. Kani's repository
script builds the pinned verifier and installs its dependencies; that cold build
counts toward the time budget. The initial cache retains Cargo downloads only,
not a complete verifier installation.

Every run records the source commit, source checksums, runner information, Kani
pin, complete verification log, exit status and GNU time resource statistics.
The appended source is included in the artifact so the checked input is reviewable.

Success requires every requested harness to verify and every reachability cover
to be satisfied. A timeout, build error or absence of harnesses is not a proof.
### Run log

- [First run](https://github.com/Tiramisu-Cake/verify-rust-std/actions/runs/37381869926),
  2026-10-06 (Europe/Moscow), source `99af1446fc89bf3792be88090eb534982d688313`:
  runner preparation and the pinned Kani 0.67.0 build succeeded. Compilation of
  the bootstrap failed with five E0433 errors: this std integration exposes
  `kani::cover` as a function, not the `kani::cover!` macro. No proof was checked.
  The five calls were changed to the function form, whose signature was checked
  in the pinned Kani source. The following run used the corrected function calls.

- [Second run](https://github.com/Tiramisu-Cake/verify-rust-std/actions/runs/37383583285),
  2026-10-06 (Europe/Moscow), source `34d008324e10a66bf59de705acd609d9509e7c36`:
  both bootstrap harnesses verified, zero failures. The arbitrary-decision proof
  satisfied 2/2 covers in 0.2443 s; the ordered-pair proof satisfied 3/3 covers in
  0.4219 s. These times are Kani verification times, excluding environment setup
  and tool compilation. Coverage remains the fixed i32 allocation/positions
  described above.

- [First insertion run](https://github.com/Tiramisu-Cake/verify-rust-std/actions/runs/37386722977),
  2026-10-06 (Europe/Moscow), source `78e99a270f7b711e4d510877de4d93a9a2da51ea`:
  Kani built successfully, but compilation stopped at stage 1 with two E0502
  errors from `old(*values)` in the adapter postconditions. No insertion proof
  was checked; composition and direct stages did not execute. The adapter now
  receives a by-value `before` snapshot constrained to equal the input. All
  three functional postconditions are retained. A fresh run is required to
  validate this workaround.

## Next experiments

1. **Completed:** bootstrap confirmed on Actions; both harnesses and all five covers pass.
2. **Prepared, awaiting verification:** the original insertion specification,
   adapter contract, modular caller and direct bounded proof are implemented.
   First run insertion_all_4 on the snapshot fix and resolve any failure.
3. Develop reusable contracts and loop invariants for the actual insertion
   helpers/loops, then prove reuse on an actual std caller. The current modular
   research caller does not establish the real outer loop.
4. Expand domain and type coverage while recording assumptions and runtimes.
   Bounds up to 16 are optional milestones, not a substitute for arbitrary
   valid lengths. Develop merge specifications after the insertion approach.
5. Cover the remaining primitives and all three small_sort implementations.
   Investigate length-32 scalability, contracts on specialized trait methods,
   ownership/unwinding and uninitialized-read coverage as separate obligations.
   Choose VeriFast or a hybrid approach on evidence from these experiments.
   See the runbook for the detailed continuation plan.

Experiments may use a larger time budget than the upstream CI; the final solution
must remain automated and acceptable to the upstream CI and review committee.
