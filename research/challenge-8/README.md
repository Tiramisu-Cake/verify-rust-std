# Challenge 8 research

Our own specifications and proofs for the actual Rust SmallSort implementation.
Other solutions may inform requirements/review concerns, but their proof code is
not imported. Runtime algorithms and generic signatures must remain unchanged.

## Start here

**Experiments are paused by the owner's explicit request.** This documentation
update does not resume them. [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) is the single current
checkpoint: established results, last failure, phase boundary and next decision.

1. [Root agent instructions](../../AGENTS.md).
2. [Current status](STATUS.md) and [operating runbook](AGENT-RUNBOOK.md).
3. [Coverage ledger](coverage.md), [Challenge 8](../../doc/src/challenges/0008-smallsort.md)
   and [general rules](../../doc/src/general-rules.md).
4. The relevant design/proof note and actual source before implementation.

The owner's server is for editing/orchestration only. All compilation,
verification and executable tests run on GitHub-hosted Actions. No workflow is
needed for this documentation change.

## Specifications and proof boundaries

- [Bounded insertion contract](insertion-contract.md): i32, lengths 1..4;
  verified adapter, research composition and separate direct outer proof.
- [All-path insertion resource ledger](INSERTION-RESOURCE-LEDGER.md): full
  normal/unwind target, ownership, actual MIR cleanup and trust boundaries.
- [Borrow recovery design](BORROW-RECOVERY-DESIGN.md) and
  [baseline/minimal-profile fixture](verifast-borrow-recovery.md): normal
  baseline success versus unresolved source applicability and panic recovery.
- [Actual Drop body](verifast-drop-gate.md) and
  [local cleanup callers](verifast-local-drop-call.md): conditional results on
  experimental patched tools, not completed generic insertion.
- [UB checks](ub-checks.md) and [outer invariant diagnostic](outer-invariant-diagnostic.md):
  measured limitations, not a complete safety proof.
- [Upstream candidates](VERIFAST-UPSTREAM-CANDIDATES.md): technical ideas only;
  no external publication or new semantic extension is authorized by that note.

## Run log

[EXPERIMENT-LOG.md](EXPERIMENT-LOG.md) preserves the former README, all run
evidence and future experiment cards/results. The former operational log is
preserved in [AGENT-RUNBOOK-ARCHIVE-2026-10-06.md](AGENT-RUNBOOK-ARCHIVE-2026-10-06.md).

[HANDOFF-2026-10-06.md](HANDOFF-2026-10-06.md) and
[REASSESSMENT-2026-10-06.md](REASSESSMENT-2026-10-06.md) are historical snapshots.
Their old "resumed", "next" and "pending" statements do not override STATUS.
Use the runbook for exact-SHA dispatch/inspection only after explicit resumption.
