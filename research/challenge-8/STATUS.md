# Challenge 8: current checkpoint

Updated 2026-10-07. **IN PROGRESS — stock generic H_align, then narrow Rust ZST layout prototype.**
Owner resumes from e170656b7ff00e8de8ac9d5ebc949d2dbf3cfd75; entry clean,
local/remote research heads match, fork Tiramisu-Cake/verify-rust-std, no active run.
Budget: at most **6 NEW manual hosted runs / 10800 summed job-seconds** including
all builds, preparation and verification. Used 0/6, 0 seconds. One experiment at a time.

First check reachable ghost cases i<1, i<2, i<3, otherwise i==3 on unchanged
official VeriFast 26.09 / source809de459 / nightly-2026-02-05. Advance ONLY when
both generic const/mut have VF exit0 and all original integrity/refinement gates pass.
Keep stock ZST failures separate; no overall-green workflow requirement.

Then implement a separate experimental layout profile limited to genuinely
fieldless, nongeneric-definition Sized Rust structs, repr(Rust)/repr(C), optional
repr(align). Compiler-backed optional size/ABIalign metadata with type/source/
target binding; Rust-only nonnegative struct-size bound. No exact facts for
fielded/generic/packed/transparent/enum/union/DST types, no offset/ownership/alias changes.
All executable checks/builds on GitHub-hosted only; stock profile kept unchanged.

RAPx CLOSED / NO-GO; B/C NOT RUN; ZST retained in target contract. Full sort4,
historical FnMut/Drop changes and external issues/PR/messages excluded.
